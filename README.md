# SpotifyAd
Python program that prevents spotify adds from appearing by closing and re-opening the app.

It only works for the Spotify App, not Spotify Web. (macOS and Windows)

It is a personal project, it is not meant to be any serious replacement or competitor ro other existing programs and apps.

*WARNING*
-----------
Windows program not currently working!

*HOW TO USE*
--------------

- Download the appropriate file (macOS or Windows)
- On your Spotify App, select the playlist you want to use when the app is openes, click share and copy the link
- Paste that link where it says: playlist_uri = "spotify:playlist:YOUR_PLAYLIST_URI", and paste the link on the YOUR_PLAYLIST_URI part
- Run the program and it should open spotify if closed, if the app is opened it will close it whenever an add appears
- It is now ready to go!
